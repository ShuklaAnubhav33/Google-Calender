# Google-Calender
Here, we're using the google-auth-oauthlib and google-api-python-client libraries provided by Google to handle the OAuth2 authentication and access the Google Calendar API.

In the GoogleCalendarInitView view, we create an OAuth2 Flow object with the client configuration provided in the Django app's settings.py file. We set the scope to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly, which allows us to read events from the user's primary calendar. We also set the redirect URI to the /rest/v1/calendar/redirect/ endpoint in our Django app.

We then generate an authorization URL using the Flow.authorization_url() method and return it in a JSON response to the client. This URL will prompt the user to grant permission for our app to access their Google Calendar.

In the GoogleCalendarRedirectView view, we create a new Flow object with the same client configuration and redirect URI as before. We then retrieve the authorization code from the query string parameters of the redirect URL.

We use the Flow.fetch_token() method to exchange the authorization code for an access token and store the resulting Credentials object. We then create a Google Calendar API client using the build() method and the credentials object.

Finally, we use the Google Calendar API client to retrieve a list of events from the user's primary calendar using the service.events().list() method. We return the list of events in a JSON response to the client.

To integrate with Google Calendar API, we need to follow the OAuth2 authorization flow. The OAuth2 authorization flow has four main steps:

Step 1: Authorization URL - The user is redirected to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint to grant permission for our application to access their Google Calendar data.

Step 2: User authorization - The user is prompted to authorize our application to access their Google Calendar data.

Step 3: Access token request - Our application sends an authorization code to Google's authorization server to get an access token.

Step 4: Accessing the API - Our application uses the access token to authenticate and authorize requests to the Google Calendar API.

We have defined two views in this file - GoogleCalendarInitView and GoogleCalendarRedirectView.

In the GoogleCalendarInitView view, we first create a Flow object using our Google OAuth2 client configuration and the required scopes. We also set the redirect URI to our GoogleCalendarRedirectView. We then generate the authorization URL and redirect the user to it.

In the GoogleCalendarRedirectView view, we first extract the authorization code from the query parameters. We then create a new Flow object using the same Google OAuth2 client configuration and redirect URI. We call fetch_token() on the Flow object to exchange the authorization code for an access token. We then use the access token to create a service object for the Google Calendar API and fetch a list of events from the user's primary calendar.

We can also define the Google OAuth2 client configuration in our Django settings.py file 

Step 1: Set up a Google API project and enable the Google Calendar API.

Step 2: Create a Django REST API project and install the required Google libraries such as google-auth and google-api-python-client.

Step 3: Create the GoogleCalendarInitView view to initiate the OAuth2 process. This view should redirect the user to the Google OAuth2 login page to authenticate and authorize access to their calendar.

Step 4: Create the GoogleCalendarRedirectView view to handle the redirect request sent by Google with the authorization code. Using the authorization code, you can request an access token from Google's OAuth2 server.
Step 5: Once you have the access token, you can use it to authenticate and authorize requests to the Google Calendar API. You can use the google-api-python-client library to interact with the Google Calendar API and retrieve a list of events in the user's calendar.
